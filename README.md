### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a seasoned software developer with nearly 9 years of experience, I specialize in creating and managing intricate web and RESTful applications. My expertise spans across PHP, MySQL, SQLite, Vue.js, and JavaScript, complemented by proficiency in Laravel Framework and Ionic. I have a track record of maintaining both private and open-source projects, and I am adept at working on Python Flask projects with MySQL databases, as well as Arduino projects utilizing a variety of sensor modules.

My ability to perform effectively under pressure ensures that I consistently meet deadlines and targets, all while delivering work of the highest quality. Collaborating within dynamic teams has not only allowed me to contribute my expertise but also provided invaluable opportunities for learning from others. In the ever-evolving realm of technology, I firmly believe that being a programmer necessitates continual learning and adaptation to the ever-changing tech landscape.

Working on open-source and private project is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. Thanks for visiting!
