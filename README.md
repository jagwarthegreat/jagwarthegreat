### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm jagwarthegreat, open-source and private repo maintainer and one of the core team members of NOTES Farm Managements System where I maintain the internal and external functions and operations in the system. I also do a monthly releases of all the patches.

In my free time I've built and maintain various open-source projects of my own like:

- Currently learning php frameworks and core operations
- Tasker - A task management with chat system and notes for keeping purposes
- Creator of Sprnva php framework (https://github.com/sprnva/sprnva)

Working on open-source and private project is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. Thanks for visiting!
