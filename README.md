### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm jagwarthegreat, open-source and private repo maintainer and one of the core team members of NOTES Farm Managements System where I maintain the internal and external functions and operations in the system. I also do a monthly releases of all the patches.

In my free time I've built and maintain various open-source projects of my own like:

- Notes Farm Management System - A management system  for farm owners and feed manufacturers.
- Currently learning php frameworks and core operations
- PMS - (a tbd name for a task management with chat system)
- Bento - A general inventory system for small stores and company
- Keep - a asset tracker and keeping system
- WIP GELICA - A pending work for church management system

Working on open-source and private project is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. Thanks for visiting!
